# Draft a professional statement

My name is Loghan. I am entry-level cybersecurity learner, who is still learning and improving the knowledge in this area. 
Through hands-on activities, I practice conducting security audits, assessing risks, and applying security frameworks to real-world scenarios.

I am interested in roles that involve security analysis, risk management, and continuous improvement of security controls.
My goal is to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles while developing the ability to communicate security concepts clearly and effectively.
